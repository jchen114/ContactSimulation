Imagine you are a blind robot. 
All you have is your innate capablity to sense your limbs, which mean the orientation and angular velocity of your limbs and pressure sensors
on your feet. Would you be able to estimate terrain properties such as slope and ground compliance?

Turns out you can!
LSTMs to the rescue!
